<h3><u>Patch Notes - 09/16/2019</u></h3>


<h3><u><b>MISSION IMPROVEMENTS</u></b></h3>

<h3><u><i><b>YOU HAVE BECOME A RIVAL</u></i></b></h3>
<p>- During the 1st cutscene, Palpatine will no longer jerk his head suddenly and will now take his time.
<br>- Added a missing sound for the final unfortunate victims of Sidious's Force Choke.
<br>- Changed the overall mechanics of stage 1 and 2. You will no longer be required to drain the health of both Maul and Savage in order to progress.
You will only be required to take down the health of one of the brothers in order to progress.
<br>- In light of the change to stages 1 and 2, Maul's health in both stages has been increased from 1000 to 1500.
<br>- In light of the change to stages 1 and 2, and due to the less challenging nature of the two brothers, Savage Opress's health has been increased from 1000 to 2500.
<br>- Corrected an issue where Savage's corpse would suddenly come back to life. If he's hit, he dies, for real.
<br>- Savage will now show an effect of the Nightsister magic leaving his body.
<br>- Created a whole new ending cutscene to overall improve the experience of the ending of the mission. The mission complete message has been removed.</p>
