<h3><u>Patch Notes - 09/02/2022</u></h3>

<h3><b><u>HIGHLIGHTS</u></b></h3>
<p>- <b>NEW MISSION: THE LAST JEDI;</b> With the Resistance cornered, Luke Skywalker confronts his nephew Ben Solo on the salt-covered world of Crait to allow the Resistance time to escape.
<br>- <b>RESTORED MISSION: FATHER VS. SON;</b> Restored after initially being cut, relive the iconic duel in Return of the Jedi, play as Luke Skywalker, Darth Vader, or Emperor Palpatine as you partake in the duel that decides the balance of the Force.
<br>
<br><b>DISCLAIMER:</b> The Father vs. Son mission is a direct port from the original mission released in Knights of the Force 2.1. As such, no changes to the original mission (except for the addition of the end credits and Luke's saber actually moving during a cutscene) have been made. Any and all remaining bugs will not be addressed in lieu of the Father vs. Son remake coming at a later date.

<br>- Changed NPC teams for the cutscene NPCs for Revan vs. Malak so they look in the direction they're supposed to more often.
