<h3><u>Patch Notes - 02/09/19</u></h3>

<h3><u><b>HIGHLIGHTS</u></b></h3>
<p><b>NEW MISSION: FATHER VS. SON; </b>Relive the climatic duel of Star Wars Episode VI: Return of the Jedi, as Luke Skywalker confronts his father, Darth Vader, for the last time. With the choice of 3 characters and 8 possible endings, your choice will descend the fragile balance of the Force toward the Light or the Dark side.</p>

<h3><u><b>MISSION IMPROVEMENTS</u></b></h3>

<h3><b><i><u>DUEL OF THE FATES</b></i></u></h3>
<p>- Changed the character selection screen to an ingame screenshot to keep consistency with future character selections.</p>

<h3><u><b>NPC IMPROVEMENTS</u></b></h3>

<h3><b><i><u>THE GALACTIC EMPIRE</b></i></u></h3>
<p>- Darth Vader has learned that the droids programmed to maintain his armor were hacked to install the Imperial March into his voice modulator to play at random intervals. He has since tracked down the offenders and executed them for their treason. With their programming back to normal, the offending song has been removed and will no longer play.</p>

<h3><u><b>AI IMPROVEMENTS</u></b></h3>
<p>- NPCs fighting for the light side of the Force can no longer kill each other on accident (or on purpose). Previously fixed, but never noted in the 8/29/18 patch.</p>

<h3><u><b>MISCELLANEOUS CHANGES</u></b></h3>
<p>- Captain Phasma's blaster immunity will now be given to players who play as her.
<br>- Players who pick Darth Talon will now be given her correct lightsaber.
<br>- Fixed an issue where players could crash after the intro video played if they didn't hit "spacebar".
<br>- Fixed a glitch in the system where the NPC spawner would instead cause the main menu music to play.</p>
