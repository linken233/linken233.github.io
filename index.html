<h3><u><b>MASSIVE BREAKTHROUGH FOUND!</b></u></h3>

<p>A massive breakthrough has been discovered in the mod! Waypoints and "smarter" npcs are at last possible. By adding in certain entities in the maps, it is now possible for allies and enemies to pursue you or other enemies. You should no longer need to worry about npcs moving too far away from each other and freezing in place, afraid of moving.

<br><br>Edits have also been made to the code for us to be able to create waypoints at an extremely rapid pace across all maps in Single Player. Full production is at last possible, but will be delayed as we address other things.

<br><br>In efforts to test this, waypoints and point_combats have been added to the Star Forge map in the mod. In addition to this, the bonus mission Revan vs. Malak has been updated to reflect these changes. You should immediately notice a difference as to how the NPCs behave.

<br><br>Small arena maps will be updated in the very near future to reflect these changes, and allow you to hopefully enjoy your interactions with the npcs.

<br><br>Please let us know your feedback as to how this works. You can download this Open Beta through the launcher at your convenience.

tl;dr: Revan vs. Malak and the Star Forge maps have waypoint and point_combat entities, and should therefore make all npcs spawned in the map much smarter in terms of following and pursuing enemies (or you).</p>
