<h3><b><i> So the updater is....once again.... not working.<br>Needless to say, I am beyond infuriated, among a whole other slew of emotions.<br>I had concluded that the cause of the updater failing over the past few months was a high amount of traffic. My solution was simple, to split up the traffic and lessen the impact.<br>It appeared to work, with these last 2 days of happy comments. But it only took one comment to make me realize that this solution, like the others, was only temporary.<br>I had hoped to make downloading the mod as convenient as possible for everyone, to allow us the freedom to release updates and patches as frequently as we'd like, but obviously this can't happen, either because of DDoS attacks on the drives, or just an increase in popularity.<br>Regardless of the cause, the current path is clear. Tonight, I will release the launcher once again, but the Updater will be removed. The Update and Install buttons will be repurposed to direct you to the Google drive folder where the mod is kept, so you can download the mod and future patches as they're released.<br>After my long roadmap is completed, I will revisit the updater and attempt an alternative solution for easier and convenient downloading.<br>I'm sorry it came to this, but I am out of ideas.As always, we're appreciative of your continued support. </i></b></h3><p></p>
<h3><u>Patch Notes - 01/05/2020</u></h3>

<h3><u><b>HIGHLIGHTS</b></u></h3>
<p>- <b>NEW MISSION: FATE OF THE REPUBLIC;</b> Experience the epic duel from Revenge Of The Sith that began the fall of the Republic. Itâ€™s fate lies in your hands. Play as Mace Windu and attempt to arrest or kill Chancellor Palpatine to protect the Republic. Play as Chancellor Palpatine, and fight Mace Windu and his pitiful Jedi band. Later on, as Anakin, you will have the choice to save the Chancellor, or to let Mace Windu do what needs to be done. The fate of the Republic rests on your shoulders. Choose wisely, for the galaxy may never be the same...

<br><br>- <b>MISSION ADDONS: OPERATION KNIGHFALL;</b> Cin Drallig's cut 2nd stage has been completed and added to his story.

<br><br>- <b>FEATURE REMOVAL: ORDER 66;</b> Due to the immense unpopularity of the Order 66 gamemode against Revan, all efforts for future Order 66 missions have been terminated and will no longer be developed. The Order 66 button has been removed from the main menu.</p>

<h3><u><b>NPC IMPROVEMENTS</b></u></h3>
<h3><u><i><b>THE REBELLION</b></i></u></h3>
- Ben Kenobi's robed NPC was mishandled and struck down, but did not become more powerful than anyone could possibly imagine. Ben Kenobi's robed NPC will now have its proper appearance.


<h3><u><b>NEW MAPS</u></b></h3>
- kotf_palp (MISSION RELATED MAP, NOT IN MAP MENU) 

<h3><u><b>BUG FIXES</u></b></h3>
- Miscellaneous bugs have been addressed for Operation: Knightfall for a more smooth experience.
