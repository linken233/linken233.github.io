(URGENT) Keep an eye out for those rebels!

(URGENT) Get security!

(DESPERATE) Don't shoot!

(STUBBORN) You won't get away with this, Rebel Scum!

(RESIGNED) Enough of this charade...

(URGENT) We need a repair crew in assembly one!

(CURIOUS) You ever fired a blaster at a living target?

(ANNOYED) No, I mean a sentient being, something that can shoot back.

(ANNOYED) You must be joking, how long has it been since you graduated?

(SEVERELY IRRITATED) What have you been doing this time? Looking the other way?

(ANNOYED) The whole galaxy's the front line now, we aren't waging a full-scale war here, we're hitting the Republic anywhere we can, so be prepared.

(SEVERELY IRRITATED, TO HERSELF) Damn rookies, no wonder we're losing our entire empire.

(CURIOUS) What have you been up to lately?

(IN DISBELIEF) Wow...why did you decide to go there?

(ANGRY) Where is the quarter master?!

(EXTREMELY ANNOYED) The latest shipment didn't have the power converters I requested!

(DISMISSIVE) See that you do!

(DISMISSIVE) Carry on!

--------ANOTHER VOICE--------

(COMMANDING) Fire!

(COMMANDING) Spread out and find him!
